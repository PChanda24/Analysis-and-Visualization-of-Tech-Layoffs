The global pandemic of COVID-19 caused unprecedented economic disruption, leading to a significant increase in layoffs across various industries. This project analyzes the patterns and impacts of these layoffs, focusing on identifying the industries and regions most affected and understanding the trends over the years.

## Data Source:
The dataset used in this analysis was obtained from Kaggle â€“ Layoff 2020. It includes detailed information on 1056 tech companies, accounting for 164,511 layoffs. In 2022 alone, 930 companies laid off 146,407 employees.

## Key findings include:
- The USA had the highest number of layoffs.
- The retail and transportation sectors were the most affected.
- Amazon, Meta, Microsoft, and Salesforce had the largest layoffs.
- Layoff trends showed significant peaks in early 2020 and 2021.

## Tableau Usage:
Tableau played a critical role in this project by enabling us to create a series of visual representations that helped us understand and communicate the dataset's insights effectively. By leveraging Tableau's powerful visualization capabilities, we were able to:
- Create dashboards that provided a comprehensive overview of the layoff data.
- Generate visualizations that highlighted trends and patterns across different industries and regions.
- Present complex data in an accessible and visually appealing format, making it easier to draw meaningful conclusions.
- Using Tableau, we translated raw data into actionable insights, facilitating a deeper understanding of the impact of layoffs on various sectors and geographies.
